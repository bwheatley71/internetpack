# Elements RTL Internet Pack

Part of the "[Elements RTL](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/rtl)" (RTL2) project, this is a cross platform TCP/IP network library for the Elements compiler, including an abstraction of both low-level IP client and server classes, as well as implementations of common TCP/IP protocols such as HTTP, POP and more.

## Origins

Internet Pack was originally written as a pure .NET library using Visual C#, for [Remoting SDK](http://www.remotingsdk.com). It is in the process of being ported/upgraded to use RTL2 and our cross-platform Hydrogene compiler, and be supported on *all* Elements platforms: .NET, Java/Android, Cocoa and Island.

The original .NET version is preserved in the `master-legacy` branch, but will no longer be maintained.

## Requirements

As of this writing, the Internet Pack library requires the latest Elements 9.2 beta compiler to be built and to be used.
